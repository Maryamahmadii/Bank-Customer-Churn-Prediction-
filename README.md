# Bank Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting bank customer churn using various machine learning algorithms, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors), and an ensemble Voting Classifier.

## Key Findings
- **Influential Features**: Age, credit score, and the number of bank products used are the most significant predictors of customer churn.
- **Model Performance**: The Random Forest and Voting Classifier models excel in predictive performance, showcasing high accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC curve measures.
- **Demographic Insights**: Female customers and those from Germany exhibit a higher propensity to churn, meriting further investigation and targeted retention strategies.
- **Predictive Success**: Our models successfully predicted 70% of customer churn cases, providing a foundation for preemptive retention efforts.

## Models Implemented
1. Decision Tree
2. Random Forest
3. Logistic Regression
4. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
5. Voting Classifier

## Conclusions
- Our models are instrumental in identifying at-risk customers, enabling the bank to take appropriate measures to reduce churn.
- The Random Forest and Voting Classifier models are particularly effective and could be prioritized for future customer retention analyses.

## Recommendations
- Investigate the reasons behind the higher churn rates in female customers and German clientele to tailor effective retention campaigns.
- Consider deploying promotional initiatives to the customers identified as likely to churn, which could improve customer retention rates.
