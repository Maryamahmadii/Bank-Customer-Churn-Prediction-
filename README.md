# Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction-
Bank Customer Churn Prediction with Decision Tree, Random forest, Logistic Regression, KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor), and Voting Classifier. 
• Based on the implemented models, customers’ age, credit score, and the number of products they use are the most important features for customer churn prediction.
• We implemented four classification models and one voting classifier to predict which customer is going to leave the bank. Among them, Random Forest and voting models have the best performance based on accuracy, precision, recall, f-1 score, and area under the curve measurements.
• Based on visualization, we conclude that women are more likely to leave the bank in comparison to Men. Moreover, almost half of the customers from Germany leave the bank. Therefore, we should investigate these two groups and find the reason so we can design proper strategies to prevent them from exiting.
• Using machine learning algorithms, we were able to predict 70% of exited customers. By offering promotions to them, it is possible to encourage them to stay.
